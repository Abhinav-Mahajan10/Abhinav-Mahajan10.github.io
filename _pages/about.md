Hi! I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Vision at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) within the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). I'm passionate about research and love diving into new and challenging concepts across vision and multimodal AI.

<!-- I recently graduated (July 2025) from the Dual-Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) program at IIIT Bangalore, where I worked in the Multimodal Perception Lab. My research focused on virtual rehabilitation agents for stroke patients, leading to a paper accepted at WCISVR 2023, along with practical deployments such as hospital-facing web tools. -->
I recently graduated (July 2025) from the Dual-Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) program at IIIT Bangalore, with a dual specialization in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AIML) and Network Communication. During my time there, I worked in the Multimodal Perception Lab, focusing on virtual rehabilitation agents for stroke patients.

<!-- I’ve had the privilege of interning twice at Adobe as a Summer Research Intern in the Collaborative Creativity Team, where I developed AI solutions for evaluating and refining graphic design aesthetics, resulting in multiple papers and a patent (USPTO filing in progress). I also spent six months at Amazon as an Applied Scientist Intern, stepping outside my comfort zone, outside Computer Vision, to work on customer next-purchase interest category propensity estimation for ranking interest categories for each customer and vice versa. This system is now in pre-production, and owing to our novel innovations, we're preparing a submission to the Applied Track of ACM SIGMOD 2026.

Thanks to these experiences, I had received full-time offers from both Adobe (Machine Learning Engineer) and Amazon (Applied Scientist I) in India. -->
I had the opportunity to intern twice at Adobe in the Collaborative Creativity Team, where I worked on AI-based solutions for evaluating and refining graphic design aesthetics. These experiences allowed me to research, innovate and implement practical solutions for real-world creative workflows.

I also spent six months at Amazon as an Applied Scientist Intern, working on customer next-purchase interest category propensity estimation. In this role, I designed models and systems to rank interest categories for each customer and vice versa, exploring problems beyond Computer Vision and gaining experience in large-scale data-driven modeling.

Building on these experiences, I’m excited to explore 3D Vision and the intersection of Vision and Reinforcement Learning with Robotics at CMU. I am also actively seeking Summer 2026 internships in Computer Vision and full-time opportunities in Research or Machine Learning Engineering after graduation in December 2026, and I welcome discussions or collaborations with anyone interested in these areas.
